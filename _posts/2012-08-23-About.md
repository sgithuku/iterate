Try. Fail. Try again. Fail. Try one more time. Succeed. Repeat.

When I was a kid I wanted to be a rocket scientist. Somewhere in between I ended up finding myself knee-deep in photography, financial modelling, mario kart, and football amongst other things. One day I'll be able to tell you which of those I was any good at.

###So, why does this exist?

There are so many people doing things that would have seemed impossible a few years ago but are commonplace today. This blog is about those things that amaze, confuse, intrigue, or even annoy me in some way. Technology of all kinds, innovative companies, people I admire, music, and Kenya are all likely topics.
